export const interaction1En = `Welcome to VMKS (Virtual Maker Space) — the virtual Maker Space of the NTU Electrical Engineering Department! Here, we provide a simple yet powerful material and tool management platform to help you easily track and organize the usage of all materials and tools. The creation of Virtual MKS aims to address common challenges faced by Maker Space members. Whether it's maintaining inventory, tracking tool usage, or scheduling shifts, these tasks can be tedious and time-consuming. We hope that by creating this platform, managing the Maker Space will become more efficient, while offering a friendly and easy-to-use environment that allows members to focus more on creative practice.

In Virtual MKS, you can effortlessly manage your inventory. With just a few simple steps, you can track the quantity of each material, ensuring that inventory is adequately stocked. When your materials are running low, the system will automatically remind you to replenish them, so you no longer have to worry about shortages.

For tool usage records, we provide the best solution. You can log each tool's usage in the system, including usage date, purpose, and user information. This not only helps in tracking the tool's status but also in understanding the usage of various resources, allowing you to make necessary adjustments when needed.

Moreover, we have specially designed a shift recording feature, making it easy to schedule and view each member's shift times. This helps ensure that every member can participate in shifts fairly, while also balancing the workload to enhance the overall team's operational efficiency.

For beginners, we place great emphasis on user experience. Through easy-to-understand tutorials, we guide you to quickly master all the features of Virtual MKS. From creating an account to adding resources and viewing reports, you will learn each operation step-by-step in the tutorials, and soon become proficient in using MKS.

We understand that the core of a Maker Space is creativity, not tedious management tasks. Therefore, we have strived to create Virtual MKS to be your assistant, allowing you to freely unleash your creativity and realize your ideas.

Thank you for choosing Virtual MKS. Let's embark on a wonderful Maker journey together! If you have any questions or suggestions about the platform, please feel free to contact us. We look forward to witnessing your amazing creations in Virtual MKS!`;

  "伏爾泰講過一段耐人尋思的話，祖國是我們心心嚮往的地方。這段話雖短，卻足以改變人類的歷史。泰戈爾曾經認為，造物主把像你這樣的人派遣到人世間來，是要你擔負一定的責任的，所以你決不應該輕視自己的身體。這啟發了我。本人也是經過了深思熟慮，在每個日日夜夜思考這個問題。塞柯爾津治曾經提過，每一次改革，無論它多麼必要，總會被一些笨蛋及過頭，於是，這一改革的本身又需要一次新的改革。這讓我的思緒清晰了。對於一般人來說，NTUEE Virtual Maker Space究竟象徵著什麼呢？在這種不可避免的衝突下，我們必須解決這個問題。NTUEE Virtual Maker Space因何而發生？ 想必大家都能了解NTUEE Virtual Maker Space的重要性。塞內加深信，智慧是唯一的自由。這句話把我們帶到了一個新的維度去思考這個問題。不難發現，問題在於該用什麼標準來做決定呢？NTUEE Virtual Maker Space可以說是有著成為常識的趨勢。要想清楚，NTUEE Virtual Maker Space，到底是一種怎麼樣的存在。動機，可以說是最單純的力量。這必定是個前衛大膽的想法。回過神才發現，思考NTUEE Virtual Maker Space的存在意義，已讓我廢寢忘食。我們不妨可以這樣來想:問題的核心究竟是什麼？我們需要淘汰舊有的觀念，緬甸講過一段耐人尋思的話，沉睡的蝦，會被急流捲走。強烈建議大家把這段話牢牢記住。領悟其中的道理也不是那麼的困難。李白說過一句著名的話，天地者，萬物之連旅;光陰者，萬代之過客。這句話語雖然很短，但令我浮想聯翩。伊索曾經提過，掩飾一個缺點，結果會暴露另一個缺點。強烈建議大家把這段話牢牢記住。NTUEE Virtual Maker Space的出現，重寫了人生的意義。而這些並不是完全重要，更加重要的問題是，池田大作說過一句富有哲理的話，不要迴避苦惱和困難，挺起身來向它挑戰，進而克服它。這句話語雖然很短，但令我浮想聯翩。巴爾扎克告訴我們，真正的科學家應當是個幻想家，誰不是幻想家，誰就只能把自己稱為實踐家。這句話看似簡單，但其中的陰鬱不禁讓人深思。每個人都不得不面對這些問題。在面對這種問題時，務必詳細考慮NTUEE Virtual Maker Space的各種可能。我們一般認為，抓住了問題的關鍵，其他一切則會迎刃而解。哈代在不經意間這樣說過，不能不考慮自己走的路是否合適，就不加思索地沿著這條路走下去，而應該考慮自己的才能和志趣，並按照這種才能和志趣改變自己的道路。希望大家能發現話中之話。";

export const interaction2En = `Voltaire once said something thought-provoking: "Our homeland is the place we long for in our hearts." Though brief, this statement is powerful enough to change human history. Tagore believed that the Creator sent people like you into the world to bear certain responsibilities, so you should never neglect your body. This inspired me. I have also pondered this deeply, considering it every day and night.

Secorzin once mentioned that every reform, no matter how necessary, will always be overdone by some fools, thus necessitating a new reform. This clarified my thoughts. For most people, what does NTUEE Virtual Maker Space symbolize? In the face of this inevitable conflict, we must address this issue. Why did NTUEE Virtual Maker Space come into being? Surely, everyone understands its importance.

Seneca firmly believed that wisdom is the only true freedom. This statement brings us to a new dimension of thinking about this issue. It is not difficult to see that the question is what standard should be used to make decisions? NTUEE Virtual Maker Space seems to have a trend of becoming common knowledge. We need to clearly understand what kind of existence NTUEE Virtual Maker Space truly is. Motivation can be considered the purest force. This must be a forward-thinking and bold idea. Only upon reflection did I realize that pondering the significance of NTUEE Virtual Maker Space has caused me sleepless nights. We might as well consider: What is the core of the issue? We need to discard old notions.

Myanmar once said something thought-provoking: "Sleeping shrimp will be carried away by the current." I strongly suggest that everyone remember this quote. Understanding its meaning is not that difficult. Li Bai once said a famous phrase: "Heaven and earth are the travelers of all things; time is the passerby of a hundred generations." Although short, these words evoke endless thoughts. Aesop once mentioned that covering up one flaw will result in revealing another. I strongly suggest that everyone remember this quote. The emergence of NTUEE Virtual Maker Space has redefined the meaning of life.

But these are not the most important issues. What is more crucial is that Ikeda Daisaku once said something philosophical: "Do not avoid troubles and difficulties; stand up and challenge them, and then overcome them." Although short, this statement evokes endless thoughts. Balzac told us that a true scientist should be a dreamer; if one is not a dreamer, they can only call themselves a practitioner. This simple statement carries a depth of thought. Everyone has to face these problems. When addressing these issues, we must carefully consider all possibilities of NTUEE Virtual Maker Space.

We generally believe that grasping the crux of the problem will resolve everything else. Hardy once casually mentioned that one should not continue down a path without considering if it is suitable, but should reflect on their talents and interests, and change their path accordingly. I hope everyone can uncover the deeper meaning in these words.
